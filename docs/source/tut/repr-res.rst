Short introduction about reproducible research
==============================================

There is more and more talking about reproducibility in research, and the topic of **reproducibility crisis** is gettting hot. Here is a `Nature article <https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970>`_ presenting a servey on the matter.

So what is reproducible research?
A research project is done in a reproducible manner if the experiment(s) conducted in the project can be replicated in the same conditions, and the same results as in the original study can be obtained.

The main factors determining if a project will end up as reproducible or irreproducible are the following:

- Organization of data and tools
- Documentation 
- Automation
